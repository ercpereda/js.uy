## About

Uruguay has great talent doing some excellent work, but we fail miserably sharing that “awesomeness” with the rest of the world, most of the developers fail to communicate their achievements, while others don’t really care.

We built `*.js.uy` as a way to list and promote all the great things we are doing as a JS community in Uruguay.

We think that getting noticed and spreading the word of what we do would have a positive impact on the developers life by enabling them to reach better clients, raise salaries and allow them to work on projects they care about.

To summarize, our goals are:

* Help people to better market themselves
* Boost collaboration among the Uruguay-based developers
* Put Uruguay on the map for the global JS community
